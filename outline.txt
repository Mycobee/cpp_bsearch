Objectives:

-Build a Binary Search Tree in C++, document the process, offer my perspective, learn (forever), not panic!!! (it's just 5 minutes)

-No searching for specific references on Binary search tree, only on the C++ language and process. 

Slide Deck rough draft:

-About me 
	Rob (GH, LinkedIn, Email)
	Rails developer, background...web development (non traditional path, want to learn and improve my knowledge of data structures)

-The Objective
	Learn a bit and begin to understand some C++
	Stipulations (no cheating, no reference on the bsearch problem)
	All the research on C++
	what == success; the tree can store and stack data...
	what == stretch goals?  delete, traverse, search

-Where we start
	C++ has classes right?  Lets make a class??
	Weigh my options...functional...prolly not cuz I am not too familiar 
	Procedural (this seems possible, and maybe the proper way to solve this problem?  But thinking about nodes and trees as one long set of steps is hard...
	Object Oriented?  Same problem/New Language...this seems like a winner for me...I need to at least get the tree to read data to be happy with this experiment
